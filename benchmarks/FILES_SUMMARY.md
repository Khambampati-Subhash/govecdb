## 🔧 Customization

### Quick Adjustments

**Test fewer dimensions** (faster):
```go
// Go
Dimensions: []int{128, 384, 768}

# Python
DIMENSIONS = [128, 384, 768]
```

**Test smaller datasets** (faster):
```go
// Go
VectorCounts: []int{1000, 5000, 10000}

# Python  
VECTOR_COUNTS = [1000, 5000, 10000]
```

**More thorough testing** (slower):
```python
DIMENSIONS = list(range(64, 2048, 64))  # Every 64 dims
VECTOR_COUNTS = [1000, 2000, 5000, 10000, 20000, 50000]
NUM_SEARCHES = 500
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### GoVecDB

**Issue**: "cannot find package"
```bash
go mod tidy
go mod download
```

**Issue**: "compilation failed"
```bash
go build ./...  # Check for errors first
```

**Issue**: "tests taking too long"
- Reduce dimensions/vector counts
- Skip large combinations

### ChromaDB

**Issue**: "chromadb not found"
```python
!pip install --upgrade chromadb numpy pandas
```

**Issue**: "out of memory"
- Use smaller vector counts
- Skip high dimensions
- Restart runtime

**Issue**: "runtime disconnected"
- Colab timeout (use Colab Pro)
- Run in smaller batches
- Save intermediate results
